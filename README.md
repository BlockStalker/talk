# 🗣️ BlockStalk(er) Talk

Our `talk` repo powers discussions over at ➡️ https://github.com/orgs/BlockStalker/discussions

Discussions have a few standard formats, we're open to creating new
[category templates](https://github.com/BlockStalker/talk/tree/main/.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE) to
facilitate them.  Please open a PR!

# Discussion Type

## Item of Interest (IOI)

IOIs are great for raising awareness on Algorand blockchain activity that may be of
interest to the community.  Use them to share curiosities, do investigative work in the context of a public
discussion board, or simply show-and-tell something cool.

## Registry Enhancement Program (REP)

The BlockStalker.IO Registry Enhancement Program is a community-driven program to enhance the metadata
on Algorand Accounts, Assets, and Applications.  For example, if you know that the [BULXL...LDMQU](https://blockstalker.io/key/BULXL4XPDYZBETNFYLSSQNITUP5DSVI3TZTKWFGDH4LV2NJAC3ICYLDMQU) address is an `Algo Foundation` account for the
purposes of `Research & Social Good`, submit an improvement via a REP report!
